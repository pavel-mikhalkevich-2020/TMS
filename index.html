        <h1> Nowadays spend a great deal of time watching television. However, television can not replace the book as a learning tool, which is why children are less-educated today. To what extent do you agree with this statement. </h1> <br> 
        In modern society people are given different learning opportunities such as television and the Internet and they are not confined to formal channels (schools). Children have got used to spending more time watching TV rather than reading books, but I don’t agree that is the major reason for reducing the level of literacy among them. <br>
        On the one hand, children definitely spend large amount of their time by watching TV programs, but to be honest, it doesn’t mean they are watching only educational or scientific shows. There are enormous <a href= pornhub.com> distracting and unprofitable shows</a>. Also, its true that television often is considered as tool for entertaining purposes. In the 21st century, the era of big data (Bigint as a data type) and rapidly changing world, it is difficult to focus on the one thing for a long time, and I suppose it’s the primary trigger of less-education. 
        It seems easier to watch a movie rather than read the whole book, but the negative impact also exists. Imagination isn’t developing and also vocabulary remains poor. This may cause lack of creativity and difficulties with shaping thoughts into comprehensible form which in its turn leads to the communication gaps in the future. 
        On the other hand, if we look at the television as an additional source of education, rather than replacement of books, we may notice that it can bring more advantages than disadvantages. Some books are written by a complex scientific language, so visualized and accompanied by sound explanation by means of IT may help understand the topic better. Also, it’s a fact that is much more interesting to watch animals, countries and history events on TV rather than just read about them. Education through leasure activities is a popular way of staying in the know. Children feel less pressure and have more spare time for other activities. 
        To sum up, I disagree that children are less-educated due to television. The modern approaches of learning should not be underestimated. However, I think only the balance combination of old-fashioned and state-of-art approaches will boost the academic performance of students.
